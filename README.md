Lottery numbers generator for german lottery '6aus49' or 'Eurojackpot'/'Euromillions' done with Streamlit

This is a quite interesting project due to it's usability and simplicity. 

From the technical point of view it's just a few nested conditional statements to raise errors if wrong number ranges are given. The numbers themselves are just variables in form of streamlit's slider features. 

If you're a lottery player, I would be thrilled if you used this little generator! May the luck be with you!
